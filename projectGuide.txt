Editor and Game can be built in Debug and Release mode. 
To run either project, set either of them to be the startup project. This will automatically compile the Scripting and Engine project when building them as well.

Debug Mode features:
- Logger to console

Make sure to set Game as the startup project to run the final product if it isn't already set.
