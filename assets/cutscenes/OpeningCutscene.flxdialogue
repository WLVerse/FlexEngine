[Cutscene_01_WakingUp]
Girl: "You're finally awake."

[Cutscene_01]
You: "Who are you...? What am I doing here?"
Girl: "You lost your memory? What's the last thing that you remember?"
You: "I was in a collapsing laboratory... and there was this terrible, anguished wail echoing all around the room, about 'taking revenge'..."
A sharp pain shot through my head, preventing me from recalling anything further.

[Cutscene_02]
Boy: "Sounds like you were right, Grace. A Drifter deliberately sabotaged the timeline, and now the world is on the verge of collapsing."

[Cutscene_03]
The girl known as Grace grimaced, as if her worst fears had come true.
Grace: "I am Grace. The boy behind me is Ash. Do you at least remember your name?"
Renko: "My name is... Renko."

[Cutscene_04]
Grace: "That's a relief."

[Cutscene_03]
Renko: "What is Ash talking about?"
Grace: "Drifters are people like you, with the ability to travel back in time. When the timeline began to collapse, I brought you back to the present to help me fix it before it's too late."
Renko: "What happens if we don't fix it? I mean, I don't even know where I should begin."
Grace: "If we don't fix it, the world will come to a cataclysmic end. I've tracked the issue to London, 1888. We should be able to manage a one-way trip there using our Chrono Gear."

[Cutscene_05]
Grace: "Speaking of which, your Chrono Gear is in a terrible state. How did you even manage to get it like that?"

[Cutscene_02_Part1_RenkoWatch]
She pointed to a watch-like object on my wrist. 

[Cutscene_02_static]
It surprising felt like a natural part of my body but...
She was right, it looked a bit charred around the edges, unlike hers.

[Cutscene_02_Part2_RenkoWatch]
I shook my head, unable to give her a response.

[Cutscene_06]
Grace looked over to Ash with a troubled look.
Grace: "Can you get it fixed, Ash?"
Ash: "On it."

[Cutscene_03_AshLeaving]
Ash: "Sit tight, I'll have it repaired in no time in my workshop."

[Cutscene_07]
Grace: "Before we leave, I want to run a simulated training of combat in London, 1888. Confrontation may be inevitable if the perpetrator's goal is revenge."

[Cutscene_08]
Grace: "Don't be alarmed, I'll be here to guide you every step of the way."

[Cutscene_04_Part1_RobotsEntering]
The sound of metal door parting distracts me from the growing unease in my heart.

[Cutscene_04_Part2_RobotsEntering]
Two robots entered the room, their displays flashing ready for combat.

[Cutscene_09]
Grace: "I'll activate the simulation now. Renko, prepare for combat!"
